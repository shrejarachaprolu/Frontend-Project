Real-Time Order Book & Trade Visualizer

A **Next.js + TypeScript** application that visualizes **live crypto market data** from Binance’s WebSocket API.  
It provides three interactive dashboards:
- **Order Book** — live bid/ask depth view  
- **Recent Trades** — real-time trade pulse and activity gauge  
- **Combined View** — both order book and trades side by side

##  Design Choices & Trade-offs

###  UI / Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast, expressive, and consistent styling.
- **Gradient backgrounds** and **glassmorphism effects** for a sleek, modern trading dashboard look.
- **Animated elements** (hover, pulse, and sync indicators) for responsive and intuitive user feedback.

###  State Management
- Used **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) for component-level state.


###  Performance
- **Memoized subcomponents** (`React.memo`) like `OrderRow` to reduce re-renders under high-frequency WebSocket updates.
- **Cumulative depth calculations** and **memoized totals** to ensure smooth visualization even with rapid data flow.

### 🔍 Data Correctness
- Periodically verifies WebSocket data against Binance’s REST API to ensure the UI remains **in sync**.
- Displays a clear **“In Sync / Out of Sync”** status indicator on each data panel.

##  Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **React 18**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Binance WebSocket API**



##  Design Rationale Example

> “I chose to use **React hooks and memoization** instead of Zustand because the project only needs **local state per component**. Zustand would add unnecessary complexity for this scope. Hooks allow efficient and isolated updates while keeping the logic transparent.”
